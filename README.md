# Abstract
Cricket is one the most watched sport now-a-days. Winning in cricket
depends on various factors like home ground advantage, performances in the
past matches, experience of the players, performance at the specific
venue, performance against the specific team and the current formof the team
and the player. In the recent past, a lot of research has been done which
measures the player ‘s performance and predicts the winning percentage.
This article briefs about the factors that cricket game depends on and
discusses various researches which predicted the winning of a team with an
advent of statistical modelling in sports. Cricket is one of the most popular team
games in the world. With this article, we embark on predicting the outcome of
Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket match using a supervised learning approach
from a team composition perspective. Our work suggests that the relative team
strength between the competing teams forms a distinctive feature for predicting
the winner.
Modelingtheteamstrength boils down to modeling individual player’s battin
g andbowling performances, forming the basis of our approach. We use statistics
and recent performance of a player to model him. Player independent factors
have also been considered in order to predict the outcome of a match. Machine
learning is used in predicting the outcome of a cricket match before and during
a match.
